1a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b) The method requires a String parameter. If you try to pass a different type
    of parameter (like an int), there will be a compile-time error.
1c) The return type is a double.

2)
Method Call                   Return Value
sentimentVal("absent");       0.08
sentimentVal("flawed");       -1.56
sentimentVal("activity");     0.59

3a) Yes. The return type of sentimentVal is a double, which matches double num.
3b) No. sentimentVal's parameter type is String. It cannot pass an int.
3c) No. sentimentVal can only pass one String, as per its method signature.

4) After the totalSentiment translated the review into a String and removed
punctuation, it iterates through every character. If the character is of the
alphabet, it adds the character to a temporary String, currentword. If the
character is a space, it finds and adds the sentimentVal to the totsentiment
variable and "restarts" currentword. It also finds the sentimentVal of
currentword after the iteration ends in case the String doesn't end with a space.

5a) The ratings do make sense. The rating for SimpleReview.txt was 2 whereas
the rating for TestReview.txt. TestReview.txt was very excited and happy
whereas SimpleReview.txt was very negative. SimpleReview.txt sounded more like
a 1 star, though.

5b)
  1) Adjust it so that certain punctuation (such as exclamation marks) amplify
the direction of the sentiment. Negative reviews become more negative and
positive reasons become more positive.
  2) Make a helper method where the number of words are also considered.
Reviews with less words would need more narrow thresholds.

6) (a) The logical error is that the first conditional, totalSentiment < 15,
makes the rest of the else if statements useless. For example, if the totalSentiment
6, that means that it is < 15. This method will then return 4. However,
the student meant to make the method return 3.
   (b) One way he could fix it is reversing the order of the conditionals. instead
of starting with totalSentiment < 15, start with totalSentiment < 0. Another way
is to make more specific conditionals. For example, instead of totalSentiment < 15,
totalSentiment < 15 && totalSentiment >= 10.

3) The indexOf method returns the index of the first occurrence of a String. One
way you can use this method to divide a String is by finding a divider and taking
the substring of the first half and the second half. The substring method returns
a String with a starting index of the first parameter and an ending index of the
last parameter. It is necessary to add 1 to the position of the space when
copying the remainder because the first parameter/starting index is inclusive.
Meaning, the space will be included in the returned String.
