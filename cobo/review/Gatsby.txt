Thank god this book is over. I never felt that much relief after finishing a book. This is a nightmare for me. I mean, what exactly is written in this novel. The Great Gatsby is considered one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. Although, to be honest, I don't care about its hype anymore; I pick F. Scott Fitzgerald's work because I thought it would blow my mind. It did, but not in a prominent way.

I am not one of those readers who DNF the book, but I thought at least three times to do that. The book is so monotonous that it suffocates me. The characters are ridiculous, and the narration is all over the place, with loose ends. People have different opinions on this book; for some, it portrays unconditional love; it was plain dumb for me.

Jay Gatsby and Daisy love each other, but she married Tom because Jay was away for some time and broke. After five years, Gatsby returns with enormous property and wants Daisy in his life. Tom has an extramarital affair; Daisy knows but doesn't care. With the help of Daisy's cousin Nick, Gatsby rekindles his love. Now there are unnecessary details, out-of-the-line characters who are self-centered and egoistic. Everyone is dying, and no one cares. This book is only 200 pages long, but it gives me a headache. I am not going to recommend this book to anyone in my life ever. This book is horrible, annoying, and forces you to smash your head on the wall.
