Compile-Time Errors: Syntax Errors
    - Incremental Development: helps find location of error quickly
    - Fix only the first error message
    - Desperate measure: make a backup file and debug by bisection. Also helps track down location of error.
    - Compiler remedies are not reliable

Run-Time Errors: Errors while Running
    - Use temporary print statements to display variable & param values and help debug
    - Use smaller test cases and methods. Organize code and make it more readable.

Logic Errors: Program Doesn't Behave as Expected
    - Using flow of execution, make sure every section works as intended
    - Rewrite code to be more readbale, perhaps by using temp variables
    - Talk to friend/duckie about the error
    - Try changing print -> println
    - Learn from finding bugs
