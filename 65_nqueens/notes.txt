HW65: How Many Queens Can a Thinker Place, If a Thinker Can Place Queens...

DISCO
---------------
(Nora's back of the envelope idea for a recursive solution going from NxN to N+1xN+1: Take an NxN
solution, and draw lines through the centers of the squares threatened diagonally by each queen.
This should look like a bunch of parallel diagonal lines on a grid.

Now, we want to figure out how to insert a row and a column somewhere in the array of queens
and empty squares such that no queen is in danger when you add a queen on the intersection
of this new column and row. Note that each vertex of the chessboard represents
a location at which you could potentially add this new queen, and choosing a vertex would
determine the location of the new queen, and the new column and row. Also note that once the new
row and column are added, the diagonal lines blocking off certain squares will remain in place.

We want to add the queen in such a way that it is not on any of the diagonal lines. Thus,
we must add it at a vertex of the chessboard which doesn't have any diagonal lines going through it.

This still has a big hole - I need to prove that you can't ever create a new endangerment situation
by adding a new row and column - but so far, it works.  )

QCC
---------------
- Removing the queen was a bit of a "hard" decision, because it wasn't totally clear that it would work out- We could only find one solution, which is disappointing to me (Josiah).
