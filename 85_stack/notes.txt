HW84 -- Stack: What Is It Good For?
2022-03-28
time spent: 0.7 hr

DISCO
- <PANCAKE> / <Courtney> in the interface doesn't matter. It just signifies
  generic typing. PANCAKE and Courtney in this case are types.
- ArrayList and LLStack have many of the same methods (such as add() and size())

QCC
- One way to make sure the file follows the "guidelines" under the interface
  is to copy the method signatures from the interface.
