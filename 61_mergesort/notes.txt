HW 60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-08
time spent: 0.5 hr

=========================
Reflection & Observables
=========================
* Every person actively involved in the process will receive an unsorted stack
of cards exactly once and a sorted stack of cards exactly once.
* If a stack of cards has more than one card, it is unsorted and thus will be
split into two stack and distributed to others unless it has been marked as
sorted.
* Every person has a minimal task to complete

=========================
DISCO
=========================
* The bigO for this algorithm is likely logarithmic since the decks are being
split in half every time.

=========================
QCC
=========================
* Is this algorithm of sorting more efficient than just sorting a large pile
all at once (by one person)?
* How might we implement this algorithm of sorting cards into a coded algorithm
for sorting lists?
* Since there are 52 cards in a deck but only 34 thinkeren/turtles, wouldn't some thinkers have more than 1 card so the list isn't fully sorted?

=========================
THINKER FIRMWARE
=========================
0: All turtles begin as termites.
1: One termite is given a stack of cards, unsorted.
2: Termite determines whether the stack of card is sorted.
3: If unsorted (> 1 card), termite splits the stack of cards into two, hands
each stack to a nearby termite, and becomes a thinker.
4: If sorted (1 card), termite becomes a thinker and returns the sorted stack
to the termite (now thinker) from whom the stack was retrieved.
5: All termites with a stack follows 2-4 until there are no more termites with
a stack of cards.
6: Thinkers receive the two sorted stacks of card from the termites (now
thinkers) and merges the decks effectively with the power of vision to sort.
7: Thinkers with one sorted stack of cards will return the stack to the termite
(now thinker) from whom the stack was retrieved.
8: The thinker with the only stack of card has a sorted stack.
