HW82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-27
time spent: hrs

DISCO:
- When compiling V6Driver.java, which calls LList.java with inner class
  MyIterator, we see LList$MyIterator.class in the directory, which indicates
  the inner class is being called.
- The method outside of the MyIterator class, iterator() is specifically what
  invokes a new instance of the inner class being called.
- The _okToRemove variable makes sure that next has been called to remove, to
  make sure that we aren't trying to remove any elements in the list before
  iterating through it since _dummy begins BEFORE the _head.
- You can assign multiple aliases for the same object in one line by using
  more than one equal sign. Specifically, the line "_dummy = _head = new DLLNode<T> (null, null, null);"
  creates a new object and sets _head as an alias for the empty list, then sets
  _dummy as an alias for _head, which would refer to the same null list.
QCC:
- What are the main benefits of using inner classes such as MyIterator in this
  case?
