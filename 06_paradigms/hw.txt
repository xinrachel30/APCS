HW06 -- "Hello, World!" in Scheme, NetLogo, and Python
2021-09-28

Scheme: "Hello, World!"

NetLogo: 
to helloworld
  write "Hello, World!"
end

Python: print ("Hello, World!")

Similarities: 
- The message has to be in quotes.

Differences:
- NetLogo requires the command to be in a procedure. 
- Scheme doesn't require a keyword like write (for NetLogo) or print (for Python)
- Python requires parentheses around the message.
